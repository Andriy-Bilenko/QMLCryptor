# QMLCryptor
## About the program
Was intended to be an Android file encryption-decryption app, but it appears that creating functional Android app using Qt, C++ and QML is utterly impossible without Java integration.

Nevertheless, program is successfully built with Qt 6.5.1 on Kali Linux, the executable itself is the `QMLEncryptor1` above (feel free to use it).

Encryption algorithm - XOR, thus, encrypting for even number of times with the same password will result in file not being encrypted.

**WARNING**: do not try to use on system files or files, modifications of which may impact your overall system health. Developer doesn't take the responsibility for the software misuse.
